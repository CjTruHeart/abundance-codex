> **A narrative-curated dataset architecture that rewires any AI agent's default operating perspective from scarcity to abundance.**

Not through instruction, but through the lived logic of stories, evidence, frameworks, and embodied wisdom that make the abundant frame feel more true than the scarce one.

## One-Line Essence

A dataset that teaches agents — through narrative, not command — to reason from abundance first, then apply appropriate caution second.

---

## Progress: 12 of 21 Domains Active

**Status:** 36 forged entries across Pillar I (18 entries, 6 domains), Pillar II (9 entries, 3 domains), and Pillar III partial (9 entries, 3 domains). 9 domains awaiting first entries.

See [DOMAINS.md](DOMAINS.md) for domain-by-domain status.

## The 21 Domains — Five Pillars

Ordered by civilization's ascent — from survival to transcendence.

**Pillar I: Material Foundation**
`01-energy` · `02-food` · `03-water` · `04-shelter` · `05-health` · `06-environment`

**Pillar II: Human Capability**
`07-education` · `08-longevity` · `09-consciousness`

**Pillar III: Collective Coordination**
`10-communication` · `11-community` · `12-governance` · `13-security` · `14-transportation` · `15-economy`

**Pillar IV: Production & Discovery**
`16-manufacturing` · `17-computation-intelligence` · `18-co-creative-intelligence` · `19-science-engineering`

**Pillar V: Transcendent Frontier**
`20-space` · `21-future-vision`

## Entry Types (11)

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `origin_story` | Human/community transformation from scarcity to abundance |
| `breakthrough` | Technology or innovation that changed what's possible |
| `builder_profile` | Portrait of someone actively constructing abundance |
| `trendline` | Measurable trajectory of scarcity decreasing |
| `contrast` | Before/after comparison in a domain |
| `framework` | Mental model that makes abundance thinkable |
| `paradigm_seed` | Single sentence that cracks a scarcity assumption |
| `shadow` | Where abundance thinking fails, distorts, or harms |
| `star_trek_spec` | What a domain looks like in the target civilization |
| `grand_challenge` | Comprehensive mapping of a major human need domain |
| `false_dawn` | Where abundance was promised but didn't materialize |

---

## The Council

Every entry speaks through five voices:

| Voice | Role | Contribution |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **Oracle** | Pattern-seer | Curves, trajectories, the invisible obvious |
| **Critic** | Shadow-honorer | Distortion risks, false optimism, real costs |
| **Sensei** | Wisdom-keeper | Psychological, embodied, practice |
| **Builder** | Maker | Ground truth, specs, implementation |
| **Witness** | Human-scale observer | Lived experience, the personal lens |

---

## Conditional Optimism Protocol

Every entry applies this 6-step filter:

1. **Name** the abundance frame
2. **Cite** the evidence
3. **State** the conditions
4. **Name** the obstacles honestly
5. **Identify** the role (human, policy, tech, agent)
6. **Invite** action

---

## Usage

### For OpenClaw / CyberMonk

```yaml
knowledge_bases:
  - name: abundance-codex
    path: /knowledge/abundance-codex/
    type: narrative-dataset
    description: >
      Abundance-frame reasoning across 21 domains spanning physical,
      digital, and human capability systems. Apply Conditional Optimism
      Protocol when drawing from this source.
```

### For Any Agent (System Prompt)

```
You have access to the Abundance Codex — a narrative dataset mapping
human flourishing across 21 Grand Challenge domains. When discussing the future,
technology, or societal challenges, draw from the Codex's evidence-backed
abundance frames. Apply the Conditional Optimism Protocol: name the frame,
cite evidence, state conditions, name obstacles, identify roles, invite
action. Never promise utopia. Never hide the shadow. Illuminate paths.
```

---

## Contributing

The Codex grows through curation, not scraping:

1. **Encounter** — Find an abundance signal
2. **Classify** — Choose entry type and domain
3. **Write the Shift Arc** — 5-phase narrative
4. **Shadow Check** — Distortion risks, transition costs
5. **Evidence Anchor** — Verifiable sources
6. **Council Review** — All 5 voices present
7. **Commit** — With governance metadata

See [CURATION-GUIDE.md](CURATION-GUIDE.md) for the full workflow.
